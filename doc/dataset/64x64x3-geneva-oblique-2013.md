This data-set is considered as homogeneous as it is created from a single sequence of photographies. It follows that the data-set elements show similar exposures, histograms and colors. In addition, the content of the data-set images is also similar as mapping a single city. The modulation of the angle of sight brought this data-set to be more heterogeneous than data-set computed from pure aerial images.

This data-set is computed through the extraction of rescaled crops performed on the original photographies. The original images copyright belongs to the [Système d'information du territoire à Genève (SITG)](http://ge.ch/sitg).
