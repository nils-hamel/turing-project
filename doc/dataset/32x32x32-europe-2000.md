## 64x64x64-europe-2000

This data-set is composed of SRTM topographic data of the whole European continent
in the year 2000. The data-set is composed of volumetric elements each encoding
one part of the European topography. The volumetric elements are 32x32x32 binary
voxels and the data-set contains 9568 elements.

The following image gives an illustration of the content of the data-set by
showing a random selection of 24 elements :

This data-set is computed by sending the following index addresses to an
eratosthene server :

    /1/950745600,0/12200******/5
    /1/950745600,0/12201******/5
    /1/950745600,0/12022******/5
    /1/950745600,0/12023******/5

Using these index leads to square cells of roughly 19 km in size and with a
voxel size of roughly 612 m.

The original topographic data belong to [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/) and [NGA](https://www.nga.mil/Pages/Default.aspx)
and are available on the following [link](https://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/srtm/).
