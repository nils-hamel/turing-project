This data-set is considered as homogeneous as it is created from a single sequence of photographies. It follows that the data-set elements show similar exposures, histograms and colors. The acquired scene being large and captured from the ground, some heterogeneity
appears in the data-set images content.

This data-set is computed through the extraction of rescaled crops performed on the original photographies. The original images copyright belongs to the [Digital Humanities Laboratory of EPFL](https://dhlab.epfl.ch/).
