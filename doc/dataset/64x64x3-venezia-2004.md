This data-set is considered as homogeneous as it is created from a single sequence of photographies. It follows that the data-set elements show similar exposures, histograms and colors. In addition, the content of the data-set images is also similar as it maps the city of Vencie as it was in 2004.

This data-set is computed through the extraction of rescaled crops performed on the original photographies. The original images copyright belongs to the [Universita Iuav di Venezia (IUAV)](http://www.iuav.it/SISTEMA-DE/Laboratori1/cosa-offri/cataloghi-/index.htm).
