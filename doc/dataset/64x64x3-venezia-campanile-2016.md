This data-set is considered as very homogenenous as it is created from a single sequence of photography all taken at the same time, with the same camera from a single point of view that is the top of the Venice campanile of San Marco. It follows that the data-set elements show similar exposures, histograms and colors. In addition, the content of the data-set images show very similar point of view of the city of Venice as it was in 2016.

This data-set is computed through the extraction of rescaled crops performed on the original photographies. The original images copyright belongs to the [Digital Humanities Laboratory of EPFL](https://dhlab.epfl.ch/).
