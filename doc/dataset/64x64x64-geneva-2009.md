## 64x64x64-geneva-2009

This data-set is composed using LIDAR data of the city of Geneva acquired in the
year 2009. The data-set is composed of volumetric elements each encoding one part
of the Geneva region. The volumetric elements are 64x64x64 binary voxels and the
data-set contains 13617 of these elements.

The following image gives an illustration of the content of the data-set by

This data-set has been computed by sending the following index addresses to a
eratosthene server :

    /1/1241136000,0/122001002343******/6
    /1/1241136000,0/122001002352******/6
    /1/1241136000,0/122001002361******/6
    /1/1241136000,0/122001002370******/6

in order to retrieve the Geneva LIDAR data previously injected in the server. The
original LIDAR data belongs to the [Système d'information du territoire à Genève (SITG)](http://ge.ch/sitg).
