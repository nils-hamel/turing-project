This data-set is considered as homogeneous as it is created from a single sequence of photographies taken with a single camera. It follows that the data-set elements show similar exposures, histograms and colors. Moreover, the interior of the Palazzo Ducale of Venice shows a very specific style that clearly appears in the similarity of the data-set images.

This data-set is computed through the extraction of rescaled crops performed on the original photographies. The original images copyright belongs to the [Digital Humanities Laboratory of EPFL](https://dhlab.epfl.ch/).
