## 64x64x64-geneva-2005

This data-set is composed of LIDAR data of the city of Geneva acquired in the
year 2005. The data-set is composed of volumetric elements each encoding one part
of the Geneva region. The volumetric elements are 32x32x32 binary voxels and the
data-set contains 13579 of these elements.

The following image gives an illustration of the content of the data-set by
showing a random selection of 24 elements :

This data-set is computed by sending the following index addresses to an
eratosthene server :

    /1/1241136000,0/122001002343******/5
    /1/1241136000,0/122001002352******/5
    /1/1241136000,0/122001002361******/5
    /1/1241136000,0/122001002370******/5

Using these index leads to square cells of roughly 153 m in size and with a
voxel size of roughly 4.8 m.

The original LIDAR data belongs to the [Système d'information du territoire à Genève (SITG)](http://ge.ch/sitg).
