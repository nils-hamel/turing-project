This data-set is considered as highly homogeneous as it is composed from a single sequence of photographies all taken at the same time, with a single camera and at the same place. It follows that the data-set elements show similar exposures, histograms and colors. In addition, the content of the data-set images is very similar as it maps one single and small square of Venice.

This data-set is computed through the extraction of rescaled crops performed on the original photographies. The original images copyright belongs to the [Digital Humanities Laboratory of EPFL](https://dhlab.epfl.ch/).
