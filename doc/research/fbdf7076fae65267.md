# Generalisation analysis according to data-sets and hidden layer size of single layer auto-encoder

This study focus on the analysis of the generalisation and training perfromance
of auto-encoder according to the considered data-set and to the size of the
hidden layer of the auto-encoder. In this study, very simple single layer
auto-encoders are considered and the size of their unique hidden layer is modulated.

The implementation of the considered auto-encoder can be found [here](https://github.com/nils-hamel/turing-project/blob/master/src/turing-auto/auto-inv-hsv-osi-l2/README.md).
