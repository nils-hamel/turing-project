## Auto-Encoder : inv-hsv-osi-l2-hsv-osi-l2

The network implementation script provides different modes. The first mode
correspond to the network training and retraining process. The second mode
allows to auto-encode image of the data-set by specified the image index range.
The two next mode allows to encode and decode specific image of the data-set again
using index range. The encoding produce a file in which the state of the hidden
layer is dumped, in text mode. The decoding mode allows to provides to the hidden
layer specific content to study the obtained output layer.
